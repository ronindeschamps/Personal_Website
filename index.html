        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Ronin Deschamps, and I am a full stack software developer.
          Currently, I am in my third year of computer science studies at Stevens
          Institute of Technology.  Low-level programming has been my most recent
          focus, learning more about Assembly language and C++. I am about to 
          tackle a new C++ project in which I will program a modular synthesizer. 
          I have also recently started working with Alex Wellerstein, creator of 
          Nuke Map, on a project open source project called AWEL, Atomic Weapons
          Effect Library. Programming is something that I deeply enjoy as it is 
          always challenging and engaging. I am a restless mind that needs
          stimulation and programming will always scratch that itch for me. 
          When I am not programming I like to produce music and cook. I am 
          partial to activities that allow me to create things and develop 
          skills that make creating intuitive. I find some the greatest pleasures
          in surprising myself when I have made something to be proud of 
          that is cohesive, expressive and authentic to myself.</p>

          <p>This project used the Geotab tracker device and the MyGeotabSDK library 
            to create a live tracking system for the Maine Maritime Academy student 
            shuttle. I wrote API calls with the MyGeotabSDK that grabbed the location 
            data of the tracker. The data was displayed as a moving vehicle on an 
            adaptive map I created with the Leaflet JavaScript Library.  The webpage
            I built was integrated by another member of the apps team into the Modo
            Labs application that is used on the back end of the Maine Maritime
            website and mobile app. This project is live at 
            https://r.mma.edu/shuttletracker/</p>

          <p>Atomic Weapons Effects Library (AWEL) is a Javascript framework for nuclear detonation effects models. It is model-agnostic and is meant to be easy to extend to add support for different kinds of models and visualizations. It includes within it a specific way of handling physical units so that it can be unit-agnostic as well. I am a contributor to this project which is being headed by Alex Wellerstein, a Professor and historian of science who specializes in the history of atomic weapons and The Cold War.</p>

          <p>The password reset tool is a desktop application designed for student workers at Maine Maritime Academy (MMA). This allows the student workers to help other students and faculty reset their account passwords without having access to administrative account permissions or passwords. I wrote the logic for authenticating computers on the domain, reworked the logic for user account authentication, and designed the user interface. The project was a joint effort with a full-time employee on the apps team at MMA.</p>

          <p>
            This fluid simulator is built in Python and based on the Eulerian model of fluid mechanics. This model is grid-based and assigns characteristics such as velocity and density to each cell in the grid. I attempted to build this simulator directly from the Eulerian mathematical equations. My simulation is not perfect, it creates ripples and demonstrates flow in a straight line but does not demonstrate the corriolis effect. I am currently revising the project to fix this issue.

          <p>This is a fully custom 8-bit CPU down to the adder and subtracter circuits. I also created a programming language, and assembler written in Python to test my CPU. This architecture supports 8-bit calculation, 16-bit instructions, and has 1024 bytes of memory. The CPU can do basic arithmetic as well as load and store instructions to and from memory. The instructions are written in a very similar fashion to ARM64 instructions and can take integer values or registers as operands. For example, my load instruction is written like this: LDR X1 X0 2 where the first register is the destination the second register holds the memory address and the third argument is the byte offset which can be a register or an integer value.</p>

          <p>Particle-Based Fluid Simulation | Python, Pymunk, Pygame
            This is a particle-based fluid simulator made in Python. Particle-based fluid mechanics, also referred to as Lagrangian mechanics or smooth particle hydrodynamics is a simulation model in which each particle has characteristics such as elasticity, density, and pressure. Each particle is tracked individually across space to simulate collisions. The reason it is referred to as ‘smooth’
            particle hydrodynamics is because density and pressure are smoothed out over the entire area of all the moving particles averaging their qualities, making the particles behave more like a fluid.

            </div>
            <p>Pringle is a custom C function that allows users to print arrays. It is very similar to printf() as it uses indicators (in this case %a) to indicate where to print arrays if they are being printed inside a string. Just like printf(), pringle() is variadic, meaning that you can print as many arrays as you want in one pringle function call. The assembly code used for this function is broken up into four files three of which are functions called by pringle. These functions are integer to ASCII, count specifiers, and concatenate array. Each function follows ARM64 assembly calling conventions so that data is never lost when jumping from function to function and when being integrated into a larger script.
